"""Package for testing the application.

The tests package storages the application's tests that them are
executed for ensuring the proper behaviour of the application.

You can get report coverage stadistics with coverage package.

Notes
-----
There are three kinds of tests created:

1. Unit testing
    It means testing individual modules of an application in
    isolation (without any interaction with dependencies) to confirm
    that the code is doing things right.

2. Integration testing
    It means checking if different modules are working fine when combined
    together as a group.

3. Functional / End-to-end testing
    It means testing a slice of functionality in the system
    (may interact with dependencies) to confirm that the code is doing the
    right things.
